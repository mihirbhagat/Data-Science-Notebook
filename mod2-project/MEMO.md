Our goal was to analyze real estate data in King County. 

We were provided with 3 data sets

Sale prices, 
Property Location
Specific Features of the Property

Using this data and our understanding of statistics and programming, we were able to build a model to predict sales price. 

Our biggest challenge was how diverse real estate neighborhoods are in Seattle. You have luxury neighborhoods like Medina, tourist hotspots like Queen Anne and several rural suburbs. 

For example, if we just ran a simple linear regression for square footage and sale price, we wouldn’t realize that increasing square footage in downtown Seattle has a much bigger impact than it would in a town in South King County. 

That’s why we created a multiple linear regression model, factoring in location. 

We were also able to validate several claims currently relying on intuition. 

For example, we were able to learn that there is no statistically significant impact on sale price of being a waterfront property, having a porch or having nuisances such as traffic or power lines.  

If we continue this project, we would explore the following: 

Seattle has seen a tremendous rise in real estate prices thanks to recent growth. We would want to 
Compare Seattle’s growth to hot real estate markets in the past (like San Francisco and New York) and present (like Austin and Denver) to predict what may happen in the future 
Look at past data to see if there’s a correlation between the home price near Amazon HQ and the growth of Amazon’s number of employees. 
Predict which Seattle suburbs may undergo gentrification, much like Brooklyn in NYC or Oakland in the Bay Area. 
Explore the potential problem and solution of availability of low-income housing

Other further analysis could include the following:
Properties which have been renovated & flipped several times 
Which season sells the most homes? 
What is the impact of crime data on real estate prices?
